To consider to be implemented:

1. It should be possible to update the configuration entry in preferences and use it immediately without reloading Brackets
  -- If some command configuration entry is not correct this should be indicated (standard popup error window?)
2. Add new variables to use for configuring commands:
  -- $CLIPBOARD - current contents of the clipboard
  -- $SELECTED_TEXT - text currently selected in the editor
3. If autohide is 'true' for some command configuration automatically hide the panel only if there were no errors.
4. Indicate errors in the console in bold and red.
5. Log messages to the console should be indicating that they are from this plugin
