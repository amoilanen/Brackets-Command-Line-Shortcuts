To consider to be implemented:

1. It should be possible to update the configuration entry in preferences and use it immediately without reloading Brackets
  -- If some command configuration entry is not correct this should be indicated (standard popup error window?)
2. Add new variables to use for configuring commands:
  -- $CLIPBOARD - current contents of the clipboard
  -- $SELECTED_TEXT - text currently selected in the editor
3. If autohide is 'true' for some command configuration automatically hide the panel only if there were no errors.
4. Indicate errors in the console in bold and red.
5. Log messages to the console should be indicating that they are from this plugin
6. Output panel visual adjustments: make the window with results resizable so that all the content can be shown, increase the default time period for which output panel is shown, when hiding the output panel fade it out gradually
7. Validate the key combinations being assigned whether they are available when configuration is saved. Improve error handling: show configuration error messages already when the plugin reads it configuration or when configuration is saved.
